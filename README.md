# Tracking and predicting the African COVID-19 pandemic

### Please Note: You are at the page that discusses the code required to reproduce the findings in the published paper "Pan-African evolution of within- and between-country COVID-19", *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* (PNAS), July 13, 2021 118 (28) e2026664118, https://www.pnas.org/content/118/28/e2026664118. If you are interested in current daily data predictions, please use the 'daily' branch of this GitHub site at [Updated Daily Code](https://github.com/Schiff-Lab/COVID19-HHH4-Africa/tree/daily), or the updated daily [Shiny App](http://146.186.149.88:3838/COVID19-HHH4-Africa-daily/).

This code was tested with R version 3.6.3 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Windows and version 4.0.2 on Mac OS

A visualization of the model inputs and published results can be found at our [R-shiny server](http://146.186.149.88:3838/COVID19-HHH4-Africa/)

Set the working directory to the one with these source files, and run these files:

- `01_data-processing-model.R`: cleans and processes the input data in `data/original` and gets it ready for modelling. The output of this script goes into the `data/processed` folder.

- `01_data-processing-plot.R`: cleans and processes the input data in `data/original` and gets it ready for plotting. The output of this script goes into the `data/processed` folder.

- `02_modelfitting.R`: uses the processed data to fit the models and saves them in `output/models/`. Summary tables are also produced and saved in `output/tables`.

- `03_figures-model.R`: uses fitted model to create figures in the `figs` folder.

- `03_figures_aux.R`: use processed data and fitted model to create other figures in the `figs` folder.

The `R` folder contains the `functions.R` file that has a set of costum functions needed to run the code.
